# FX-ownCLOUD-Client
ownCLOUD client written in Delphi

Client completely written in Delphi - the latest build in Delphi using VCL components.
It allows you to connect to any ownCLOUD server and perform basic operations on files and directories in this system.
What may be useful are the options of calling it from the command line with parameters, thanks to which we can automate some of the works on the ownCLOUD cloud.
